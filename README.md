# HOLBERTON SCHOOL — simple_shell

Minimal UNIX command line interpreter written in C.
Holberton School project: simple_shell.

---

## Compilation

bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
./hsh

---

## Usage

./hsh
$ ls
$ /bin/ls
$ ls -l /tmp
$ exit

- The prompt is displayed only if stdin is a terminal (isatty).
- Ctrl+D (EOF) exits the shell.
- Ctrl+C prints a new prompt without exiting.

---

## Core behavior

Input reading
- Uses getline() to read input from stdin.
- A loop processes one command per line.

Command splitting
- The input line is split into a char ** using strtow().
- Separators handled: space, tab, newline.
- ':' is also handled internally for PATH splitting.

PATH handling
- get_path() retrieves PATH from the environment.
- If the command is not a direct path (/ or ./), PATH directories are searched.
- When found, cmd[0] is replaced with the full executable path.
- fork() is never called if the command does not exist.

Execution
- execve_cmd():
  - fork()
  - child process runs execve()
  - parent waits with waitpid()

Error handling
- Errors match /bin/sh output format.
- Example:
./hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
- Errors are printed to stderr.

## Builtins (depending on task progression)

exit
- exit
- exit N (status modulo 256)

env
- prints the current environment
